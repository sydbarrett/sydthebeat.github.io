This work extends popular star-convexity and other more general forms of convexity priors. We represent an object as a union of "convex" overlappable subsets. Since an arbitrary shape can always be divided into convex parts, our regularization model restricts the number of such parts. Previous k-part shape priors are limited to disjoint parts. For example, one approach segments an object via optimizing its k coverage by disjoint convex parts, which we show is highly sensitive to local minima. In contrast, our shape model allows the convex parts to overlap, which both relaxes and simplifies the coverage problem, e.g. fewer parts are needed to represent any object. As shown in the paper, for many forms of convexity our regularization model is significantly more descriptive for any given k. Our shape prior is useful in practice, e.g. biomedical applications, and its optimization is robust to local minima.

Star-convexity prior is popular for interactive single object segmentation due to its simplicity and amenability to binary graph cut optimization. We propose a more general multi-object segmentation approach. Moreover, each object can be constrained by a more descriptive shape prior, “hedgehog”. Each hedgehog shape has its surface normals locally constrained by an arbitrary given vector field, e.g. gradient of the user-scribble distance transform. In contrast to star-convexity, the tightness of our normal constraint can be changed giving better control over allowed shapes. For example, looser constraints, i.e. wider cones of allowed normals, give more relaxed hedgehog shapes. On the other hand, the tightest constraint enforces skeleton consistency with the scribbles. In general, hedgehog shapes are more descriptive than a star, which is only a special case corresponding to a radial vector field and weakest tightness. Our approach has significantly more applications than standard single star-convex segmentation, e.g. in medical data we can separate multiple non-star organs with similar appearances and weak edges. Optimization is done by our modified α-expansion moves shown to be submodular for multi-hedgehog shapes.

Many standard optimization methods for and reconstruction compute ML model estimates for appearance or geometry of segments, e.g. (Zhu and Yuille 1996), (Torr 1998), (Chan and Vese 2001), GrabCut , (Delong et al. 2012). We observe that the standard likelihood term in these formulations corresponds to a generalized probabilistic K-means energy. In learning it is well known that this energy has a strong bias to clusters of equal size, which we express as a penalty for KL divergence from a uniform distribution of cardinalities. However, this volumetric bias has been mostly ignored in computer vision. We demonstrate significant artifacts in standard segmentation and reconstruction methods due to this bias. Moreover, we propose binary and multi-label optimization techniques that either (a) remove this bias or (b) replace it by a KL divergence term for any given target volume distribution. Our general ideas apply to continuous or discrete energy formulations in segmentation, stereo, and other reconstruction problems.

Standard geometric model fitting methods take as an input a fixed set of feature pairs greedily matched based only on their appearances. Inadvertently, many valid matches are discarded due to repetitive texture or large baseline between view points. To address this problem, matching should consider both feature appearances and geometric fitting errors. We jointly solve feature matching and multi-model fitting problems by optimizing one energy. The formulation is based on our generalization of the assignment problem and its efficient mincost-max-flow solver. Our approach significantly increases the number of correctly matched features, improves the accuracy of fitted models, and is robust to larger baselines.

The α-expansion algorithm has had a significant impact in computer vision due to its generality, effectiveness, and speed. Thus far it can only minimize energies that involve unary, pairwise, and specialized higher-order terms. Our main contribution is to extend α-expansion so that it can simultaneously optimize “label costs” as well. An energy with label costs can penalize a solution based on the set of labels that appear in it. The simplest special case is to penalize the number of labels in the solution. Our energy is quite general, and we prove optimality bounds for our algorithm. A natural application of label costs is multi-model fitting, and we demonstrate several such applications in vision: homography detection, motion segmentation, and unsupervised image segmentation. Our C++/MATLAB implementation is publicly available.

Geometric model fitting is a typical chicken & egg problem: data points should be clustered based on geometric proximity to models whose unknown parameters must be estimated at the same time. Most existing methods, including generalizations of RANSAC, greedily search for models with most inliers (within a threshold) ignoring overall classification of points. We formulate geometric multi-model fitting as an optimal labeling problem with a global energy function balancing geometric errors and regularity of inlier clusters. Regularization based on spatial coherence (on some near-neighbor graph) and/or label costs is NP hard. Standard combinatorial algorithms with guaranteed approximation bounds (e.g. α-expansion) can minimize such regularization energies over a finite set of labels, but they are not directly applicable to a continuum of labels, e.g. R2 in line fitting. Our proposed approach (PEARL) combines model sampling from data points as in RANSAC with iterative re-estimation of inliers and models parameters based on a global regularization functional. This technique efficiently explores the continuum of labels in the context of energy minimization. In practice, PEARL converges to a good quality local minimum of the energy automatically selecting a small number of models that best explain the whole data set. Our tests demonstrate that our energy-based approach significantly improves the current state of the art in geometric model fitting currently dominated by various greedy generalizations of RANSAC.

Overlapping colors and cluttered or weak edges are common segmentation problems requiring additional regularization. For example, star-convexity is popular for interactive single object segmentation due to simplicity and amenability to exact graph cut optimization. This paper proposes an approach to multi-object segmentation where objects could be restricted to separate “hedgehog” shapes. We show that α-expansion moves are submodular for our multi-shape constraints. Each “hedgehog” shape has its surface normals constrained by some vector field, e.g. gradients of a distance transform for user scribbles. Tight constraint give an extreme case of a shape prior enforcing skeleton consistency with the scribbles. Wider cones of allowed normals gives more relaxed hedgehog shapes. A single click and ±90◦ normal orientation constraints reduce our hedgehog prior to star-convexity. If all hedgehogs come from single clicks then our approach defines multi-star prior. Our general method has significantly more applications than standard one-star segmentation. For example, in medical data we can separate multiple non-star organs with similar appearances and weak or noisy edges.

We observe that the standard likelihood term in these formulations corresponds to a generalized probabilistic K-means energy. In learning it is well known that this energy has a strong bias to clusters of equal size, which can be expressed as a penalty for KL divergence from a uniform distribution of cardinalities. However, this volumetric bias has been mostly ignored in computer vision. We demonstrate significant artifacts in standard segmentation and reconstruction methods due to this bias. Moreover, we propose binary and multi-label optimization techniques that either (a) remove this bias or (b) replace it by a KL divergence term for any given target volume distribution. Our general ideas apply to many continuous or discrete energy formulations in segmentation, stereo, and other reconstruction problems.

Many standard approaches for geometric model fitting are based on prematched image features. Typically, such pre-matching uses only feature appearances (e.g. SIFT) and a large number of non-unique features must be discarded in order to control the false positive rate. In contrast, we solve feature matching and multi-model fitting problems in a joint optimization framework. This paper proposes several fit-&-match energy formulations based on a generalization of the assignment problem. We developed an efficient solver based on min-cost-max-flow algorithm that finds near optimal solutions. Our approach significantly increases the number of detected matches. In practice, energy-based joint fitting & matching allows to increase the distance between view-points previously restricted by robustness of local SIFT-matching and to improve the model fitting accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art multi-model fitting techniques.

The alpha-expansion algorithm has had a significant impact in computer vision due to its generality, effectiveness, and speed. Thus far it can only minimize energies that involve unary, pairwise, and specialized higher-order terms. Our main contribution is to extend alpha-expansion so that it can simultaneously optimize “label costs” as well. An energy with label costs can penalize a solution based on the set of labels that appear in it. The simplest special case is to penalize the number of labels in the solution. Our energy is quite general, and we prove optimality bounds for our algorithm. A natural application of label costs is multi-model fitting, and we demonstrate several such applications in vision: homography detection, motion segmentation, and unsupervised image segmentation. Our C++/MATLAB implementation is publicly available.
